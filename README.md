With a focus on ease of use, it provides efficient tools for common tasks like creating, renaming, moving, copying, deleting, uploading, downloading and manipulating files and folders.

## Requirements
The project is really simple, but needs some tools to work, see the table below:

| COMPOSER | 2.0 or Higher  | Required    |
| APACHE   | 2.2 or Higher  | Required    |
